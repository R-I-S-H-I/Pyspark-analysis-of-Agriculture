# Agricultural Yield Analysis with PySpark
## This project analyzes agricultural yield data across different regions using PySpark, a powerful distributed computing framework for big data processing.

1. Project Overview
  - This analysis aims to:
  > Explore crop yield patterns across various regions
> 
  > Identify factors influencing agricultural productivity
> 
  > Predict future crop yields based on historical data and environmental factors
2. Data Sources
  - The project utilizes the following data:
  > Crop yield data from - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samuelotiattakorah/agriculture-crop-yield
> 
  > Weather data from - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samuelotiattakorah/agriculture-crop-yield
>
